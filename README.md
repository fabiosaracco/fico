It is part of Fabio's PErsonal PAckage (PePa) repository's project.

It should probably install automatically.

* setup.py: the setup, easy as this.
* fico.py: calculate fitness and complexity and reorder matrices
* updater.py: it just contain a function (update) returning the string in object and information about the time when the function was called.
